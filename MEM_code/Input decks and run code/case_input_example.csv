"Under key word definition, undefined keywords may be any number of spaces, or a null string",,,,,,,,,,,,

Note that demand has no decisions.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note that unmet demand is represented a source with a variable cost only, so unmet demand has an output decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,

REQUIRED KEYWORDS,,,,,,,,,,,,
tech_name,"Name of technology, must be unique",,,,,,,,,,,
tech_type,"One of 'non-dispatchable generator', 'generator', 'curtailment', 'lost_load', 'storage',  'transfer', or 'transmission'",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
OPTIONAL KEYWORDS,,,,,,,,,,,,
node_to,"Name of node from which this technology would get or give its energy (or in the case of transmission, the receiving node)",,,,,,,,,,,
node_from,"Name of auxially node, e.g., node from transmission will get its energy",,,,,,,,,,,
series_file,Pointer to time series file that will ultimately get loaded under the keyword <series>,,,,,,,,,,,
normalization,"Possible non-negative number. If 'normalization' is defined, then the series associated with that tech (defined by series_file) is transformed to have a mean equal to the number supplied",,,,,,,,,,,
capacity,"Option to specify the capacity of a technology. If this number is supplied, then the technology capacity is fixed and is not included as a decision variable in the optimization",,,,,,,,,,,
fixed_cost,Fixed cost; must be defined if n_capacity > 0,,,,,,,,,,,
var_cost,Variable cost; must be defined if n_dispatch_in > 0 or n_dispatchout > 0,,,,,,,,,,,
charging_time,"Possible contraint for case when n_capacity = 1, n_dispatch_in =1 and n_dispatch_out = 1 (e.g., battery)",,,,,,,,,,,
efficiency,"Possible factor for case when n_capacity = 1, n_dispatch_in =1 and n_dispatch_out = 1 (e.g., battery), applied on way in to reservoir; also known as round trip efficiency",,,,,,,,,,,
decay_rate,Possible decay rate for storage in units of fraction per time step,,,,,,,,,,,
