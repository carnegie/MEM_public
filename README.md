# Repository documenting the 'Planning resource adequacy of wind- and solar-based electricity systems' paper

The paper is currently under review and a citation will be added once available.

The code within documents:
 * The Conda environment used for the analysis in `environment.yaml`
 * Results can be reproduced using the `*.sh` files which run many iterations of the model with different combinations of weather years. Users should be careful about the number of jobs spawned by some of these files which might crash CPUs with limited memory.
 * The `*.ipynb` files in `plotting-scripts/final_scripts/` can be used to recreate the figures in the main text and select supplementary figures. In some cases, a user may be required to download the raw analysis output files which a stored seperately on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/10403697
